## Game Logic

1.The game board consists of a 3x3 grid represented by buttons.
2.Winning patterns are defined, and the game checks for these patterns after each move.
3.The checkWinner() function iterates over each winning pattern and compares the values in the corresponding grid cells to determine a winner.
4.The game state is managed using JavaScript, and the UI is updated accordingly based on player actions and game outcomes.
